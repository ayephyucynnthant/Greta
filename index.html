                <p>Wishing you a very special birthday full of laughter and joy, my yang☯️. <p>
               <p>May Lord grant you light & guidance when you are lost, and may he wash away your sorrow when your heart is heavy.<p>
               <p> Anyway, I’ve been thinking about what I could possibly say that does justice to how much I appreciate you — and honestly, I don’t think words will ever be enough. But I’ll try anyway, because you deserve to hear it.</p>
               <p>You are one of those rare people who carries both strength and softness in perfect balance. You’ve got this incredible presence — strong, grounded, and magnetic — yet you also have a heart that feels everything deeply.
                 You’ve always inspired me with how you handle life: the way you push through when things get heavy, the way you still choose kindness, the way you never lose your fire.
                  You make strength look effortless, and love feel safe.</p>
            <p>I’m so grateful for everything we’ve shared — the memories, the laughter, the quiet talks, even the difficult moments. 
                They’ve all meant something real to me. You’ve had such a lasting impact on my life; you made me see love differently, care more deeply, and understand myself better.
                 I honestly believe I’m a better person because I knew you, because I love you, and because you love me back.</p>

<p>Even though things have changed between us, what hasn’t changed is how much I value you — who you are, not just what we had. You’re someone I’ll always root for, no matter what. You deserve every bit of peace, happiness, and success coming your way.

I hope your birthday is a reminder of how loved you are — not just by me, but by everyone lucky enough to know you. You bring so much light and strength into the world, and I hope you take a moment to feel that reflected back at you today.

Happy birthday, my love. Thank you for being you — for your heart, your strength, and the way you’ve touched my life in a way that will never fade. ❤️</p>
